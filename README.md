# Intermittent Firebase Authentication Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Firebase authentication fails intermittently without providing clear error messages. The authentication process sometimes succeeds, but frequently fails without any indication of the cause.  The code includes both the buggy implementation and a proposed solution.

## Bug Description

The provided JavaScript code uses Firebase Authentication to register and sign in users.  However, the authentication process is unreliable. It sometimes works correctly, allowing users to successfully register and sign in. Other times, the authentication attempts fail without providing any meaningful error messages, making debugging challenging.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing robust error handling to catch and log Firebase authentication errors.  This allows for a more accurate determination of the cause of authentication failures.  Additionally, it helps in providing users with more informative feedback.
